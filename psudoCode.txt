Questions
How do we only allow one button click per tile? 
HTML/CSS
Conditional rendering
Is it an X in the square or a O
Who wins? X or O or also if the Cat

Atoms
Tiles
Using bootstrap on a div to make it .col-4

Div.container
	Div.row
		div.col-4

Organism
Tiles - click events
Board as whole
Buttons (restart)


Objectives
The game should let the players know who's turn it is.
Player x or player O
Remove EventListeners
Game tiles should only be clickable once
if the game is over they should not be clickable at all.
The game should display who wins the game if someone wins, otherwise, say that the game resulted in a tie.
There should be a Restart Game button that does not refresh the page (set state).
On each player’s turn, that player places one of their symbols on an unoccupied space by clicking.
The game continues until one player places three symbols in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and wins or there are no remaining available spaces and it is a draw.
Only have a single <div id="app"></div> in your index.HTML (try to code golf the HTML file)

Question: 
How do I store current user ? Have  a var called current user that stores current user
 Should I store user array locations in array for user 1 & 2  or 
What about scratch games/ties 



Each box needs
An eventlistener
Unique id 
Functions
init()
Parse through array and make event listener
for (i in boardstate) 
make new col-4 with id equal to ( `box${i}`)
event listener(‘click’, func(boardstate[i] {      }
if clicked, function stores current user in boardstate array index


Event Listener when clicked must
	-check current user
	-change innerhtml of current box from “ ” to o/x dependent on user
		-if current user is 1, switch to 2 
		-if current user is 2, switch to 1 
	-
      - 	check	
checkWin()
Make new array based on board state that contains the indexes of current user’s x/o . Then compare that array to all the win conditions to see if its true 

For (i in boardstate)
if (boardstate[i] == current user )
newArr += i
for(i of winConditions)
if(winCondition == newArr)


	
switchPlayer()
If currentPlayer == ‘X’
currentPlayer = ‘O’
Else
currentPlayer = ‘X’
makeMove()
Adds the current player to the tile clicked
checkWin()
If win do endGame()
else
Switches the currentPlayer in state
Removes the eventListener
endGame()
Display the winner of the game
Remove all event listeners
Show reset game button

resetGame()
Drawboard
Resets state to initial values
Procedures

INIT
Draw the board with js
make title and button
render empty ttt board that matches the empty array 

click square
returns current user to index in state array of box clicked
delete t-t-t board 
check to see if someone has won (for of loop)
Parse over each win condition and compare to board state for only current user
If someone has won 
Build Board with no event listeners
Display user that won
If all items in state array are filled with content display “tie”
Else build board and switch user
